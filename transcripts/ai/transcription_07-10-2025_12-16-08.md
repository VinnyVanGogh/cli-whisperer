# UI Enhancement Plan

## Objective
Improve the user interface (UI) to facilitate easier operation and management of runs, especially distinguishing between continuous and non-continuous processes.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Use of Textual for Continuous Runs
- When the process is **continuous**, utilize **Textual** to:
  - Make it easier to work through ongoing tasks.
  - Manage and monitor continuous operations effectively.

### 2. Use of Rich for Non-Continuous Runs
- For **non-continuous** or quick one-off runs, utilize **Rich** to:
  - Provide clear and concise output.
  - Simplify the viewing of quick results.

## Benefits
- Simplifies the process of:
  - Continuing runs
  - Exiting operations
  - Stopping early
- Eliminates the need for manual interruption methods such as `Ctrl+C`.

## Summary
- Default to **Textual** for continuous processes.
- Use **Rich** for quick, non-continuous tasks.
- Overall, this approach will streamline UI interactions and improve user experience.
