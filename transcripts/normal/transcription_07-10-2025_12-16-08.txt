So once you're done with that, we need to make the UI better. By doing that, we can use textual if it is the continuous, so it's easier to work through. Then we can use rich if it's not continuous. That way it's easy to look at if it's just a quick one run and when we're doing continuous, which is the default that will use textual and the easier to continue runs and stuff and exit things like that. And stop early, all of that will be a lot easier using textual than having to do stuff like control C to stop early.
